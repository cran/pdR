}
\description{This package designs a specification function ptm() which estimates the panel threshold model of Hansen(1999). The key feature of ptm() is to generalize the original code to allow multiple (more-than-one) regime-dependent independent variables; Dr. Hansen's original code admits only 1 regime-dependent independent variable.

}
\details{In addition to Dr. Hanse's contributions to threshold modeling, in the future, this package plans to include some special panel unit root tests based upon instrument generating functions(IGF), proposed by Chang (2002, J. of Econometrics), and seasonal panel unit root test, and regression quantile panel linear model(rqplm).
